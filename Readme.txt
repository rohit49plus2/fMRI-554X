Image Feature decoding

Ignore the label identification python files, they don't seem promising.

run
1. rohit_image_features.py
2. rohit_merge_image.py
3. rohit_final_image.py

results should be printed in output and pickle file stored in /results/feature-decoding-final

these are uploaded in the git and you can just run 4 instead.

4. can run rohit_show_image_results.py again to load up the pickle files and see the results again
