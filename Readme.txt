Image Feature decoding

Ignore the label identification python files, they don't seem promising.

run
1. rohit-image-features.py
2. rohit-merge-image.py
3. rohit-final-image.py

results should be printed in output and pickle file stored in /results/feature-decoding-final

4. can run rohit-show-image-results.py again to load up the pickle and see the results again
